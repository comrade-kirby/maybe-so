  <h2>HOW WE DO IT</h2>
  <div class='how-we-do-it-explanations'>
    <div class='explanation'>
      <h5>WE'RE NEVER DONE LEARNING.</h5>
      <p>We’re experts, but every project is different, and technology is ever-changing. That means we approach each project as an opportunity to level-up. If you like our previous work, I bet you we can do better.</p>
    </div>
    <div class='explanation'>
      <h5>WE CONSIDER ALL THE OPTIONS.</h5>
      <p>We’re not here to waste anyone’s time chasing after ideas that don’t actually solve the problem. We take the time to think strategically about your unique needs, and then generate options to address them. </p>
    </div>
    <div class='explanation'>
      <h5>WE DO WORK LIKE THE BIG AGENCIES, WITHOUT THE BIG PRICE TAGS.</h5>
      <p>We’re resourceful and versatile. We hold ourselves to a high standard and expect our clients to do the same. But we’re also a small, young studio, and that makes us scrappy. That means we can do more to accommodate different budgets. </p>
    </div>
    <div class='explanation'>
      <h5>WE'RE WITH YOU EVERY STEP OF THE WAY</h5>
      <p>We make sure you never feel lost in the process. We’re all about communication, and that means breaking our process down and getting your insight and input throughout the project.
